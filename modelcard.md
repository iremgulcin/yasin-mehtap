# MODEL CARD

# Model Card for Anemia Detection Model

This model detects anemia in children under the age of 5 using palm images.

## Model Details

### Model Description

This model utilizes multiple pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including CNN, MobileNetV2, VGG16, and InceptionV3, for the task of anemia detection using palm images. Each architecture brings its own strengths and characteristics to the task, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of different approaches to image classification.
